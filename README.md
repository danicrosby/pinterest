# Pretty-Much Pinterest [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/d45bc7de-76ce-4361-93c0-fb4ce316dc9c/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/elated-jackson-a848ca/deploys)

Hello, and welcome to my app, Almost-Pinterest. It is a simplified version of the popular website Pinterest, which is a visual discovery engine for finding ideas like recipes, home, and style inspiration. When a user discovers Pins they love, they can save them to boards to keep their ideas organized and easy to find. This version includes a way for users to create boards and pin cards to the boards.
