# Pretty-Much Pinterest

Hello, and welcome to my app, Almost-Pinterest. It is a simplified version of the popular website Pinterest, which is a visual discovery engine for finding ideas like recipes, home, and style inspiration. When a user discovers Pins they love, they can save them to boards to keep their ideas organized and easy to find. This version includes a way for users to create boards and pin cards to the boards.
